This is a setup guide for those struggling to get a plex/jellyfin stack up and running (with nvidia)

I created an optional install script that aims to resolve a few common issues I experienced during installation:

Dependancies, this installs common depenencies needed for the stack including:

python3-setuptools
docker.io
docker-compose


Things you need to do:

- Install nvidia driver. Link to guide from JellyFin setup


- Download mullvad vpn WireGuard config:
When getting the wiregaurd information ensure to download the JSON file, the private key that is presented in the browser is NOT the key you will be using.




Setup guide 1:
- Install nvidia drivers



Setup guide 2:
Not using install script:
- Install nvidia drivers
- Clone repository
- Ensure dependancies are installed already
- Edit .env file to include:
{base path} . Where you want your config's and library to be kept
{ip address} . Your LAN IP address
{tz}. Your timezone

Testing VPN functionality: (METHOD1)
it is important to test VPN functionality to ensure there are no misconfigurations. Failure to do so may alret your ISP that you are downloading torrents, which may be against their TOS
To ensure the functionality is working as intented we will configure a firefox docker container which sends its traffic through gluetun. If it is working properly you can navigate to mullvad.net,
where you can test.

Testing VPN functionality: (METHOD2)
#Get shell inside qbittorrent container
docker exec -it qbittorrent /bin/bash
#Get public IP
curl -4 icanhazip.com
#exit
exit

*Make sure you compare curl -4 on host computer and container to verify that public IP of qbittorrent is different


Service URL's


Powershell script to open all URL's in firefox


## NOTES FOR ME

Script:
#CHECKS
1. Check if root
2. Check if software installed
3. Check if nvidia drivers installed (if not exit)
4. Check if mullvad.json file exists (not actual name of file, search for .json?) in cwd.
5. Run docker compose on .yaml file 
6. Shutdown Qbittorrent
7. Edit Qbittorrent config file (to correct password)
8. Start Qbittorrent
9. Verify containers are running, no issues
10. Print service URL's
PULL REPO (COMPOSE/ENV FILES)
get env variables from user? (get user to put mullvad.json in same dir??) read from mullvad.json set other vars, so should only need:
IP ADDRESS
BASE PATH

POST INSTALL GUIDE:
Link to: https://github.com/Morzomb/All-jellyfin-media-server

#IF YOU DO THIS MAKE SURE YOU CHANGE PORT ON ONE SERVICE. BOTH USE :5800
Ensure Jdownloader2 is part of the stack (or change port for this)
Maybe put FF as part of the stack (Dont do this) 

Also need small script to stop DL functions


And more guides

Starting all containers:
doccker-compose -f custom-mullvad.yaml up -d

Stoping all containers: 
docker-compose -f custom-mullvad.yaml down

Stoping certain container:
docker stop qbittorrent

Starting individual container:
docker start qbittorrent

Restarting:
docker restart qbittorrent

GUIDE:
guide for changing base path (shutdown container)
guide for editing config files (shutdown container)


To do:
- Add jdonwloader-2 to .yaml
- Add ability to deploy FF in vpn context for testing
- Script to set .env (?)
- Service URL printing
- Guides for:
1. Downloading mullvad .json
2. Testing VPN (FF && CURL)
3. Installing dependancies
4. Installing nvidia drivers
5. Qbittorrent manual reconfigure (PASSWORD PROBLEM)
6. Post install guide (use ultimate guides)
7. Test with a plex container && overseerr
8. PLEX HAS DIFFERENT REQUIRMENTS (INCLUDING PLEX_CLAIM TOKEN)
